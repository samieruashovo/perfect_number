What is a perfect number?

Imagine we have the number 6. The factors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6. If we add up all the factors except 6, we get:

1 + 2 + 3 = 6

And guess what? 6 is the number we started with! So, 6 is a perfect number because it equals the sum of its factors (excluding itself).

Another example is the number 28. Its factors are 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, and 28. If we add up all the factors except 28, we get:

1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28

Once again, the sum of its factors (excluding itself) equals the number itself. So, 28 is also a perfect number.

Euclid, over two thousand years ago, showed that all even perfect numbers can be represented by, N = 2p-1(2p -1) where p is a prime for which 2p -1 is a Mersenne prime.

Perfect numbers are pretty cool because there aren't many of them, and mathematicians have been fascinated by them for centuries!
